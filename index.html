      <p>Monday, February 3rd was a tough day for the Iowa Democratic Caucus. A glitch in a recently launched app to report results meant that voting outcomes were significantly delayed. While the US waited with baited breath, a narrative started to emerge that the faulty app was indicative of vote rigging. The conspiracy theory was encouraged by prominent political figures and news outlets which led people to search for information online about “Iowa Caucuses Rigged.” This in turn, led to claims that in the absence of credible, authoritative information that the Iowa Caucuses were <em>not</em> rigged, conspiracy theorists and propagandists successfully hijacked public discourse. Pushing a fringe narrative during such a crucial moment in the US’s political calendar would surely undermine the eventual election results and erode people’s trust in democratic processes.</p>

      <h2><a name="Part1"></a>Part 1: What is the current framing around data voids?</h2>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">Despite recent improvements made in the information ecosystem, not all topics are covered with equal rigor by authoritative, credible sources – nor is it possible to do so. This is where we return to our exploration of data voids.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">To explore how data voids are currently framed, we will first examine an oft-cited data void: the term “crisis actor.” Historically, “crisis actors'' referred to the use of actors in emergency preparedness training. Crisis actors would play the role of victims or perpetrators in helping first responders prepare for disaster scenarios. Over time, the term was co-opted by conspiracy theorists to refer to genuine victims of violent events (mass shootings, terrorist attacks, etc) in an attempt to prove that an event was staged or did not happen. The co-opted use of “crisis actor” first cropped up prominently amongst conspiracy theorists after the shooting at a school in Sandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">While the facts of the conspiracy itself were <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sandy-hook-exposed/" target="_blank">quickly debunked</a>, the crisis actor narrative continued and grew. From the time of the Sandy Hook shooting onwards, online interest in the term "crisis actor" remains low but fairly steady, with noticeable spikes around key breaking news events such as the LAX shooting in 2013, Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016, and the Las Vegas shooting in 2017. This trend changed in 2018, when the term “crisis actor” was thrust into the mainstream.</p>

    <article class="fl w-60-l w-100 f4">
      <p class="measure lh-copy">In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shootings in Parkland, in which 17 people were killed, a survivor named David Hogg was accused of being a crisis actor resulting in a huge increase of attention to the term. As this spike in search interest grew, authoritative media sources began to run stories to debunk the term “crisis actor” and the related conspiracy theory. On the evening of February 20th <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/us/david-hogg-conspiracy-theories-response/index.html" target="_blank">Anderson Cooper interviewed David Hogg on CNN</a> to respond to these conspiracies, which appears to have fed the surge in search interest. By the following morning, as search interest peaked, mainstream media sources like VOX and USA today continued to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/21/conspiracy-theorists-find-florida-student-activists-too-good-true/358148002/" target="_blank">debunk the narrative</a>. Once these credible, mainstream sources enter the discussion, it appears that an individual searching for the term "crisis actor" – on its own or in relation to David Hogg and the Parkland shooting - would almost certainly be shown accurate content highlighting the term as misinformation. At this point we may consider a data void as closed due to an abundance of authoritative, credible information.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Both the Iowa caucuses and crisis actor data void cases offer a glimpse into the sheer breadth and scope of data voids that can exist. Theoretically, any search query could be used as a coded message or gateway to an unsavory data void, and there have been many coordinated efforts on 4chan to evade content moderation censorship by using common terms such as <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/google-yahoo-skittles-skype-used-place-racial-slurs-twitter/" target="_blank">"Google", "Yahoo", and "Skittles"</a> as racist dog-whistles. In its most harmless form, a data void could emerge around a suddenly viral meme, such as when the term <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/generously-buttered-noodles-meme/" target="_blank">generously buttered noodles"</a> emerged from the New York Times cooking comment section in January 2019.<sup><a href="#ref_noodles">1</a></sup></p>
