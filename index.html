      <p>The risks posed by “data voids” – the absence of high-quality, authoritative sources in search results – have only recently been explored in the context of disinformation. As gatekeepers to the information ecosystem that are both collaboratively created from public contributions, Google and Wikipedia (which features prominently in search results) are vulnerable to media manipulators seeking to distort the narrative.
        
      This project aims to add more structure and empirical data to the understanding of this challenge with: 1) a Harms Framework to evaluate existing and emerging data voids, and 2) a data-driven method to map the life cycle of data voids across Google search trends, Mediacloud journalistic coverage, and Wikipedia page edits.
      
      The life cycle timelines point to a distinction between the "interest spikes" of breaking news data voids, which are quickly filled by mainstream news coverage, and more "long tail" data voids which persist over time and slowly accumulate problematic content. The timelines also highlight the interconnected relationship between mainstream media coverage and organic search in both covering and amplifying disinformation messages, and reinforce Wikipedia's role as a potential future battleground for disinformation campaigns.
      
      By providing a theoretical framework on how to assess emerging data voids and a programmatic script to analyze cross-platform media coverage, we are able to better understand the scope of the problem. However, this opens up a number of questions and areas for future research on how to appropriately develop policy responses to address emerging data voids.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Monday, February 3rd was a tough day for the Iowa Democratic Caucus. A glitch in a recently launched app to report results meant that voting outcomes were significantly delayed. While the US waited with baited breath, a narrative started to emerge that the faulty app was indicative of vote rigging. The conspiracy theory was encouraged by prominent political figures and news outlets which led people to search for information online about “Iowa Caucuses Rigged.” This in turn, led to claims that in the absence of credible, authoritative information that the Iowa Caucuses were <em>not</em> rigged, conspiracy theorists and propagandists successfully hijacked public discourse. Pushing a fringe narrative during such a crucial moment in the US’s political calendar would surely undermine the eventual election results and erode people’s trust in democratic processes.</p>
      
      <p class="measure lh-copy">This and other recent events have ignited questions in American society on how users search for and are influenced by information. From civic trust during the Iowa Caucus to public health and safety during COVID-19, concerns have been raised over the presence of misinformation within important social and political issues, and to what extent this misinformation hijacks the public narrative when credible information is not available to balance it out.</p>

    </article>

    <article class="fl w-60-l w-100 f4">
      <p class="measure lh-copy">Despite recent improvements made in the information ecosystem, not all topics are covered with equal rigor by authoritative, credible sources – nor is it possible to do so. This is where we return to our exploration of data voids.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">To explore how data voids are currently framed, we will first examine an oft-cited data void: the term “crisis actor.” Historically, “crisis actors'' referred to the use of actors in emergency preparedness training. Crisis actors would play the role of victims or perpetrators in helping first responders prepare for disaster scenarios. Over time, the term was co-opted by conspiracy theorists to refer to genuine victims of violent events (mass shootings, terrorist attacks, etc) in an attempt to prove that an event was staged or did not happen. The co-opted use of “crisis actor” first cropped up prominently amongst conspiracy theorists after the shooting at a school in Sandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">While the facts of the conspiracy itself were <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sandy-hook-exposed/" target="_blank">quickly debunked</a>, the crisis actor narrative continued and grew. From the time of the Sandy Hook shooting onwards, online interest in the term "crisis actor" remains low but fairly steady, with noticeable spikes around key breaking news events such as the LAX shooting in 2013, Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016, and the Las Vegas shooting in 2017. This trend changed in 2018, when the term “crisis actor” was thrust into the mainstream.</p>

    <article class="fl w-60-l w-100 f4">
      <p class="measure lh-copy">In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shootings in Parkland, in which 17 people were killed, a survivor named David Hogg was accused of being a crisis actor resulting in a huge increase of attention to the term. As this spike in search interest grew, authoritative media sources began to run stories to debunk the term “crisis actor” and the related conspiracy theory. On the evening of February 20th <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/us/david-hogg-conspiracy-theories-response/index.html" target="_blank">Anderson Cooper interviewed David Hogg on CNN</a> to respond to these conspiracies, which appears to have fed the surge in search interest. By the following morning, as search interest peaked, mainstream media sources like VOX and USA today continued to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/21/conspiracy-theorists-find-florida-student-activists-too-good-true/358148002/" target="_blank">debunk the narrative</a>. Once these credible, mainstream sources enter the discussion, it appears that an individual searching for the term "crisis actor" – on its own or in relation to David Hogg and the Parkland shooting - would almost certainly be shown accurate content highlighting the term as misinformation. At this point we may consider a data void as closed due to an abundance of authoritative, credible information.</p>

In its most harmless form, a data void could emerge around a suddenly viral meme, such as when the term <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/generously-buttered-noodles-meme/" target="_blank">generously buttered noodles"</a> emerged from the New York Times cooking comment section in January 2019.<sup><a href="#ref_noodles">1</a></sup></p>

The second state is the <b><em>long tail</em></b>, before or after the spike, when the narrative around a topic persists and develops over a long stretch of time under the public radar and with a relatively low volume of search activity (such as "crisis actor" before the Parkland shooting). Examples of both categories are also offered by Golebiewski and boyd initial paper introducing data voids, such as “was the Holocaust real?” as a low-lying query that has simmered across the internet for years, and “Sutherland Springs” as a query catapulted into the mainstream during a mass shooting in November 2017.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">In each of these states, there is potential harm that a data void can cause. In the long-tail state, a (relatively) small number of searchers may engage with misinformation or conspiracies which could stand uncorrected for long periods of time. In a breaking news spike, large numbers of searchers looking to learn more about a recent event may be shown misinformation or conspiracy content (generated either before or after the event), including potentially material created by bad actors consciously capitalizing on the influx of attention to a topic. Golebiewski and boyd take a clear stance on the relative importance and harm posed by both of these states by asserting that “generally speaking, data voids are not a liability until something happens that results in an increase of searches on a term” (<a href="#ref_Golebiewski">Golebiweski and boyd 2019</a>).</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy"><b><em>In the broader discussion of data voids, there has notably been a void of quantitative, reproducible data that could help us better understand this phenomenon in mis/disinformation.</em></b> Given this, our team was curious to dig deeper and inject data into the conversation. Could we evaluate this claim and observe how the surfacing of information (both credible and malicious) surrounding these breaking news data voids played out? Was it possible to approximate what these massive numbers of users saw when they searched for these terms?</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">To begin, we compiled a list of breaking news search terms / data voids associated with misinformation as the subjects for our study. In keeping with previous researchers, to avoid amplifying new harmful topics, we stuck to known data voids. For search terms that on their face were innocuous, we identified associated misinformation / conspiracies that began to spread online, so that we could track when those topics were covered by the mainstream media. 
      </p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy"><b><em>Next, we aligned on our goal: to create a timeline of credible information and mainstream coverage around each of these search terms. </em></b>As the Data & Society authors note, data voids are filled when credible information addresses the misinformation related to a topic, in that “the time between the first report and the creation of massive news content is when manipulators have the largest opportunity to capture attention” (<a href="#ref_Golebiewski">Golebiweski and boyd 2019</a>). In an ideal world we could compile a list of the exact results users were shown when they searched for that term at a specific time (e.g. “50% of users who searched "Sutherland springs" within a few hours of the event were shown Reddit threads touting conspiracy theories”). Given that this data is not available publicly, we decided to create a timeline that includes both search activity for a breaking news data void, and the presence of authoritative media sources addressing / correcting misinformation related to that subject. 
      </p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy"><b><em>Finally, we amassed the data needed to create this timeline for each breaking news data void.</em></b> We utilized publicly-available Google Search Trends data to quantify the number of searches for a particular term over time (note that Google normalizes all search trends data with 0 being minimal search volume and 100 being maximum for that term).  To approximate the presence of media articles on a topic, we examined 2 data sets: <a href="http://mediacloud.org/" target="_blank">MIT & Berkman Klein Center’s MediaCloud system</a> (an archive of media stories from across the web) and <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" target="_blank">Wikipedia article data</a> (given the prominent role that Wikipedia plays in search engine results, such as the Knowledge Panel on Google). </p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">The patterns we observe in the graphs below lead us to several key findings:</p>


      <!-- FINDING -->
      <h3 class="mt5 lh-title">Mainstream media’s capacity to respond to fast-moving misinformation is complicated and varied.</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">To illustrate this, consider examples where the media were timely in responding directly to conspiracies and misinformation, as well as times they were not. In the case of the 2020 Iowa Caucuses, numerous mainstream outlets (Seattle Times, MSNBC, and more) posted content specifically addressing misinformation that the Caucus was rigged during - and even slightly before - searches for Iowa Caucus spiked. This indicates that the searchers who pulled out their phones and laptops during these “crucial hours” (as Golebiweski and boyd phrase it) would have been presented with credible sources. On the other hand, the Sutherland Springs mass shooting reveals some room for improvement, with sites like the Washington Post and FactCheck.org correcting misinformation (related to Antifa being responsible for the shooting) hours or even days after search activity quieted down (although it is important to note that smaller news sources like the San Antonio Express, as well as a few blogs, did cover Antifa misinformation in a much more timely manner, and are likely to have shown up in early search results).</p>



      <!-- FINDING -->
      <h3 class="mt5 lh-title">Amplification or Inoculation?</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">For these search terms, the peak in search interest was always predated by some mainstream media coverage. This seems to confirm an important point from Golebiewski & boyd, that mainstream media’s tendency to quickly generate content and draw attention to unfolding events often amplifies attention and helps drive search interest. However this also raises a key paradox in our exploration of data voids. If a data void is defined as a search query that does not surface any authoritative sources, then we must consider a void filled when authoritative media sources are included in top search results, and Wikipedia includes relevant information. In each case we looked at we found a clear correlation between increased search interest and an increase in the availability of authoritative information. As attention spikes mainstream media publish more information directly addressing the relevant term, and therefore fill the void.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">One of the most stark examples we observed in our data was with the term “crisis actor”, when the previously-mentioned Anderson Cooper interview drove massive search interest from viewers to this term that had been discussed online at a low level for several years. This raises a critical question: <em>when is media attention a good thing, and when is it harmful?</em> An argument can be made that this media coverage is positive based on inoculation theory, which is centered on informing readers of misinformation and proactively labeling it as false. It can also be seen as harmful amplification of otherwise latent misinformation, giving a platform and voice to content that otherwise would have passed under-the-radar. The same mainstream media reporting that "fills the void" for a given term may lead audiences to seek out and engage with disinformation and conspiracy content. At this stage it is hard to quantify the harms of amplification compared to those of leaving a void unfilled. However it is critical that we recognize that post-void amplification and data voids where no authoritative content exists are two markedly seperate - if closely related - problems.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Discussions with breaking news reporters about the events in the crucial minutes and hours of an event such as a school shooting shed light on both the strengths and the drawbacks of the media process. Mainstream media sources that have a dedicated breaking news team aim to publish something in response to an event like the Sutherlands Springs shooting extremely quickly - in some cases perhaps as soon as 20 minutes after the event itself. Monitoring social media, including accounts of local authorities or dedicated to police scanners, allows newsrooms to be alerted to such events increasingly quickly. Confirming details, however, will always take time. The faster an article is published, the less detail it is likely to contain - especially as mainstream media are ethically committed (and otherwise incentivised) to not getting things wrong. These initial article stubs will be added to as more details emerge. With ethical constraints limiting media reporting of details such as the names of perpetrators or victims until they are confirmed by appropriate authorities, publication of these details can lag behind public discussion. Online, true facts about the event shared by eyewitnesses through social media or other channels may mingle with rumor, conspiracy and deliberate disinformation. It is this mixture of good information and garbage that seems to dominate a breaking news event, rather than a true "void" or complete absence of authoritative content.</p>

      <!-- FINDING -->
      <h3 class="mt5 lh-title">Sting in the Tail</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">While the exposure to much wider audiences delivered by a spike in search interest undoubtedly creates a large potential for harm, the presence of at least some authoritative information either before or during these search spikes leads us to question whether our definition of harm should be focused on breaking news data voids, as Gobeliewski & boyd originally stated. Rather, for many data voids the greatest harm could be manifested well before there is a surge in search interest (for example, in the 6 years 2012-2018 we observed as the long tail for “crisis actor”<a href="#ref_SandyHook"><sup>6</sup></a>). It is during the long tail period, when a user searching for a given subject will find no accurate or authoritative results, that conspiracy and disinformation narratives develop and grow communities of interest. When a spike of search interest does occur these established ideas are able to find new audiences, pushed through social media and other platforms - from cable television to celebrity endorsements - even after authoritative counter information is readily available via search.</p>


      <!-- FINDING -->
      <h3 class="mt5 lh-title">Wikipedia as a battleground for misinformation</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">There are extremely good reasons why Wikipedia is ranked so highly in Google search results. But the crowdsourced nature of the platform does make it vulnerable to disinformation actors and media manipulators, and these vulnerabilities are amplified by the close relationship with Google search and other platforms.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Turning back to our example of "crisis actor", in the history of Wikipedia edits we can clearly see a battle being waged between mis/disinfo actors and long-term Wikipedia editors. In the days after the Parkland shooting, the Crisis Actor wikipedia page saw multiple attempts at “spam, abuse, bias, and conspiracy theories” with bad actors peddling false narratives about the mass shooting. Eventually, the Wikipedia page was classified as “Protected” to limit who can modify that article due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crisis_actor&offset=&limit=500&action=history" target="_blank">“persistent vandalism and garbage edits”</a> (the same Wikipedia edit wars can be seen across multiple data void topics, including the 2020 Iowa Caucuses and Pizzagate).</p>
      
      <p class="measure lh-copy">Wikipedia has already made huge steps to mitigate these risks. Better understanding and documentation of how these manipulations play out - particularly as they move to platforms outside of Wikipedia itself - will help continued resilience building.</p>

    <article class="fl w-60-l w-100 f4">
      <p class="measure lh-copy">The concept of a "data void" around particular search terms, potentially weaponized by disinformation actors, is a relatively new and powerful one. Thinking about the problem of misinformation and disinformation through this prism helps us to understand the wider information ecosystem. Many related questions remain to be explored.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">If data voids are a potential pathway to misinformation and radicalization, what pathways bring people to the data void itself? People looking for content about “crisis actors” have almost certainly already encountered the term somewhere else, and are searching for more information, beit confirmation, contradiction, or simply context. People who ask Google “is the holocaust real?” would seem to have already opened the window to doubt. Exposure to these terms and ideas may come via a meme or a message board, cable TV or a Presidential press conference. Whatever the medium, this initial exposure is arguably the critical point of contagion, even if it is the resulting search activity that ultimately leads to belief and even radicalization. Understanding what drives people to search for these terms is as important as understanding what information they surface when they do so. </p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Our research into the timelines of specific data voids has led us to concentrate on the distinction between breaking news events and those problematic or weaponized terms that deepen and develop in the long tail of search interest. Based on the data it is our assessment that the biggest spikes in search interest into a specific term are not necessarily the most harmful, at least when framed exclusively as a data void. Good information is reasonably quickly available within these timeframes - perhaps surprisingly so given the inherent chaos of breaking news. But exposing wider audiences to problematic ideas is likely to be harmful, even when good information and “fact checks” are readily accessible. People may be inclined to believe or take interest in a conspiracy despite quick or concurrent exposure to accurate information. People are like that. Exploring the development of communities of interest around disinformation and conspiracy content that grow in the long tail of search interest is essential, and understanding if and how these communities expand when these ideas are exposed to new audiences through rapid media amplification is of great importance. </p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">A better understanding of the relationship between social media and authoritative media when it comes to developing and amplifying narratives is also of obvious interest. A preliminary investigation using CrowdTangle to compare Facebook and Reddit activity with the search and media graphs above seems to indicate that authoritative sources ultimately receive significantly more engagement, but problematic content is more likely to appear on social media first. This aligns with our understanding of disinformation models and is not surprising. For practical reasons disinformation and media manipulation is likely to directly focus efforts on social media and “fringe” websites, allowing them to seed narratives, develop communities - create content around strategic terms. Further pinning down the transition between ground laying that occurs within a data void and wider exposure that comes when a void is filled seems possible with the data available.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Better understanding how authoritative media sources cover breaking news stories and how this affects the timing and ranking of search results has the potential to help both media and search platforms mitigate much of the risk of these data voids. How do we ensure that the results from authoritative sources appear first during a breaking news event, even if they lack specific details that people might be searching for? This is potentially a consideration for social platforms like Twitter and Facebook in particular, where “top” results based on engagement may contain disinformation. When looking at the short timelines between events and reporting it is also imperative to better understand how updated news stories affect search results. From a research perspective we have questions about how these updated stories are indexed and surfaced through tools such as MediaCloud and CrowdTangle, given that information containing search terms may be added after initial publication, potentially confusing timelines.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">The prominent use of Wikipedia in search engine tools and results presents a potentially valuable opportunity for both research and practical improvements for mitigating risks of disinformation and misinformation. The ability to track every change on Wikipedia allows unique insight into how manipulation plays out and is resolved. Guidelines for editing and layout of controversial pages already exist, but may be further developed with their impact on tools such as Google Knowledge Graphs taken into further consideration.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">As is true for anyone studying misinformation and disinformation, our research team is left with just as many - if not many more - questions as answers. One in particular has captured our attention, which we’d like to leave you with.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">The term “data void” implies very simply that what is missing is data. That if only data (or information more broadly) were readily available to a user, the issue would be fixed as users would be able to access credible and authoritative content on a topic. But there is an important gap with this hypothesis, in that it doesn’t explain how misinformation and conspiracy still percolates within topics for which there exists plenty of credible information all over the web.</p>
      
      <p class="measure lh-copy">Perhaps what a data void needs is not only data, but also trust. It needs an underlying connection to a user that stumbles upon that information, which gives them a reason to not only read it, but to believe it. And not only to believe it, but to evangelize it and proactively raise it when faced with misinformation in the future.</p>
      
      <p class="measure lh-copy">Until we understand how to fill data voids with both data and trust, there will be always be a gap between what is known and what is believed.</p>
